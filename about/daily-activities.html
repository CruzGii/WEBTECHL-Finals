                <p class="paragraph">Hamsters are naturally active and curious animals, so incorporating a variety 
                    of daily activities into their routine is essential for their physical and mental well-being. 
                    One of the primary activities for hamsters is exercise, which can be facilitated through an 
                    exercise wheel. Providing a sturdy, appropriately-sized wheel allows them to run and expend 
                    energy, helping to prevent obesity and boredom. Hamsters generally enjoy running, and it can 
                    also serve as a fun way for them to explore their surroundings safely.
                    In addition to exercise wheels, setting up tunnels and mazes can significantly enhance their 
                    daily playtime. Hamsters love to explore new environments, so creating a habitat with various 
                    tunnels and hideaways stimulates their natural instincts to burrow and scavenge. This setup 
                    encourages physical activity while allowing them to engage in their natural behaviors. 
                    Additionally, changing the layout of their habitat occasionally keeps things fresh and 
                    interesting for your hamster, encouraging them to explore and interact with their space more.</p> <br>

                <p class="paragraph" style="padding-bottom: 50px;">Social interaction is another crucial aspect of a 
                    hamster's daily activities. Regular handling helps them become accustomed to human contact, making 
                    them friendlier and more comfortable over time. It's essential to hold them gently and allow them to 
                    explore your hands at their own pace. You can also encourage interaction by providing toys that 
                    require them to use their paws or nose, such as treat-dispensing toys. These activities not only enrich 
                    their day but also help strengthen the bond between you and your pet.
                    Finally, mental stimulation is just as important as physical activity for hamsters. Introducing new toys 
                    and treats, such as chew toys or foraging puzzles, can keep them engaged and encourage problem-solving 
                    behaviors. Offering a variety of snacks, like small pieces of fruits or veggies, also stimulates their 
                    senses. By mixing up their daily routine and providing diverse activities, you help ensure that your 
                    hamster remains active, happy, and mentally stimulated.</p>
