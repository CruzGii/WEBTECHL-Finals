                <hr> <br> <br>
                <p class="paragraph">Maintaining proper hygiene is crucial for the health and well-being of your hamster. 
                    Regularly cleaning their cage helps prevent odors, reduces the risk of bacterial growth, and ensures 
                    a comfortable living environment. Spot-cleaning should be done daily to remove any soiled bedding, 
                    uneaten food, and waste. Additionally, a thorough cleaning of the entire cage should occur weekly. 
                    This process includes replacing old bedding, washing toys, and wiping down surfaces with pet-safe 
                    cleaners. A clean habitat not only promotes good health but also reduces stress for your hamster.
                    Grooming is another essential aspect of hamster hygiene. Although hamsters are generally good at 
                    self-grooming, some breeds, particularly long-haired ones, may require extra attention. Regular 
                    brushing can help prevent matting and reduce shedding while also allowing you to check for any skin 
                    irritations or parasites. Use a soft brush designed for small animals to make grooming a pleasant 
                    experience for your hamster. Establishing a grooming routine early on can help your pet become more 
                    comfortable with handling.</p> <br>

                <p class="paragraph" style="padding-bottom: 50px;">The quality of bedding material is also important for 
                    hamster hygiene. Choose bedding that is absorbent, safe, and dust-free to minimize respiratory issues. 
                    Avoid cedar or pine shavings, as they can release harmful oils that irritate your hamster's lungs. 
                    Instead, opt for paper-based bedding, aspen shavings, or aspen bedding. Ensure that the bedding is deep 
                    enough to allow your hamster to burrow comfortably, as this behavior is natural for them and helps them 
                    feel secure.
                    Finally, regular health checks play a vital role in maintaining hygiene and overall well-being. Keep an 
                    eye out for signs of illness, such as changes in behavior, appetite, or physical appearance. It's also 
                    important to monitor their teeth and nails, as overgrown teeth or nails can lead to health issues. If 
                    you notice anything unusual, consult a veterinarian experienced with small animals. By prioritizing 
                    hygiene and health checks, you ensure that your hamster lives a long, healthy, and happy life.</p>
