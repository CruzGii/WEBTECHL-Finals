                    Hamsters, part of the Cricetinae subfamily, include 18 species of Eurasian rodents 
                    known for their internal cheek pouches. The Syrian or golden hamster (Mesocricetus 
                    auratus) is a popular pet. Hamsters have stout bodies, short tails, small furry ears, 
                    short legs, and broad feet. Their thick fur varies from gray to reddish-brown, while 
                    their underbellies range from white to gray and black. Species like the Dzhungarian 
                    hamster (Phodopus sungorus) and striped dwarf hamster (Cricetulus barabensis) feature 
                    a dark stripe along their back. Dwarf desert hamsters (genus Phodopus) are the smallest, 
                    measuring 5 to 10 cm long, while the common hamster (Cricetus cricetus) is the largest, 
                    reaching up to 34 cm, excluding a short 6 cm tail.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Hamsters are mostly solitary and nocturnal, though they may be active at dawn or dusk. 
                    Excellent diggers, they create burrows with multiple entrances and chambers for nesting 
                    and storing food. Some, like the striped hairy-footed hamster (P. sungorus), use tunnels 
                    made by other mammals. Their diet mainly consists of grains, along with fruits, roots, 
                    green plants, invertebrates, and small animals. Hamsters transport food in their large 
                    cheek pouches to store in their burrows. While they don't hibernate, some may enter torpor 
                    for days or weeks. They breed from April to October, producing 1 to 13 offspring per litter 
                    after a gestation of 13 to 22 days, with 2 to 5 litters each season.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Hamsters' northern range spans from central Europe across Siberia, Mongolia, northern China, and into 
                    Korea, while their southern range extends from Syria to Pakistan. They thrive in various dry, open 
                    environments such as desert edges, vegetated sand dunes, rocky foothills, plateaus, river valleys, and 
                    mountain steppes, with some species living in cultivated areas. Their geographic distribution differs 
                    significantly by species. For instance, the common hamster inhabits regions from central Europe to 
                    western Siberia and northwestern China, whereas the golden hamster has only been found near a small 
                    town in northwestern Syria. In the 1930s, zoologists collected a litter of 10 young golden hamsters 
                    from this area and brought them to Europe, where they successfully bred and increased in number.</p>
